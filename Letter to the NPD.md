Letter to the NPD

You can keep dragging me into this cycle.
We can go back and forth, over and over again—
for the rest of my life,
or even after I am gone.

But no matter how long it lasts,
you will never get away with it.

Every lie leaves a trace.
Every manipulation carries its own shadow.
Every time you try to rewrite the story,
the truth remains, unshaken.

So keep going, if that’s what you need.
But understand this:
your “victory” is only temporary,
your control only an illusion.

I endure, not because I submit,
but because I know the truth never dies.
